Following sets to wallpaper representing the closest place with smallest timezone offset (accurate to hours) from the current Timezone/City on the system.
We should only add places where we have established community etc.

git clone git@github.com:lkocman/geo-wallpapers.git
cd geo-wallpapers
./set_wallpaper_by_geo
```
